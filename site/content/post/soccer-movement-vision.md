<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">Have you ever wondered how English premier league players like David Silva, Jordan Henderson and Juan Mata are able to launch such precise passes with so little time to make a decision?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sure, their technique is sublime, but on closer inspection there’s a supreme level of intelligence which makes the difference between them and the others. It’s all about the decisions they make seconds before they launch that pinpoint cross or rocket shot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their superb decision making skills come from two areas of their game:</span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><b>Vision + Movement</b></span></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good Vision:</span> <em>The ability to spot teammates and opportunities and making intelligent decisions with or without possession of the ball. </em></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good Movement:</span> <em>The ability to make runs on and off the ball which create space and/or provide support to teammates. </em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These are two essential attributes for central midfielders. Even if you’re reading this and you’re not a midfielder, the principles that apply here relate to every position on the pitch. For example, as a striker you can benefit from having an understanding with your midfield partner (like Henderson/Sturridge). As a defender, you can gain an understanding of how dangerous space can be exploited at the very top level.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the video below, you’ll see 8 examples of superb vision and movement by the players best at this. This video moves quick and fast, so stay concentrated, don’t skip and pause if need be. Lets go!</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a few key points to take away from this video. These points demonstrate how you can improve your soccer vision and movement:</span></p>

<ol>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1"><span class="s1">All players demonstrate that they think two (sometimes three) passes ahead, so when they receive the ball they know exactly who and where they’ll pass the ball to.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
 	<li class="p1">Quick ‘give and go’, 1-2 movement gets you away from your marker and frees up space so you can switch play, make a pass and even get in a goal scoring/chance creating situation.</li>
 	<li class="p1">Sturridge and Henderson have an excellent midfield-striker partnership. If you want to score more as a striker, or assist more as a midfielder, communicate with your teammates before a match, even show them these clips so they can see what can be achieved when you have an understanding.</li>
</ol>
