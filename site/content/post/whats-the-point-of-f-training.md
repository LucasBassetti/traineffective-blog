<p>Couple months ago, Finnish football legend Mixu Paatelainen (the first Finn to ever play in the Premier League, current Dundee United coach) was fuming with rage when his team was hammered by Celtic.</p>
<blockquote class="graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">“Players in those situations, where they should be their sharpest, and know exactly what to do, which we covered in the training ground — we (they) don't do it — so, what’s the point of doing that? What’s the point of <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">f****** training</strong>?…”</blockquote>
<p class="graf--p">For all those media houses and supporters giving Mixu a hard time: a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/3q9ssj/new_dundee_united_manager_mixu_paatelainen_after/">redditor</a> explained that Mixu lived in the same city as him and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“even after he had finished playing professionally this guy would go down the local park in all weathers to train on his own. I remember being at the park in the morning in December, with snow falling and freezing temperatures: the guy was laying out cones to do shuttle runs and dribbling exercises. This guy’s attitude was top notch.”</em></p>
<p class="graf--p">Though it’s understood that Dundee United is not the best bunch of players, rarely displaying any intensity out in training — walking around the pitch, no one seems to be sprinting — Mixu has every reason to be enraged by the lack of efforts from his players, which brought us to the point:</p>

<h4 class="graf--h4">1. To ‘play in the dark’</h4>

<div class="graf--mixtapeEmbed">Back when I was in high school band, our mentor suggested that we should ‘practice in the dark’. Only by practicing in the dark can the band achieve the best synchronization and perhaps the optimal mastery of content. Once you have internalized the process by repetitive practices, so much that you can play in the dark, that’s when you can perform in any circumstances.</div>
<p class="graf--p">My hardened mentor also said ‘stage fright’ was an excuse made up by people who don’t know their stuff. The only way to achieve perfect showmanship is to spend hours on end honing your craft. Steve Jobs spent days rehearsing every part of those presentation when he presented new Apple products.</p>
<p class="graf--p">Yes, mastery of content majorly boosts confidence.</p>

<h4 class="graf--h4">2. To fulfill (and exceed) your role</h4>
<p class="graf--p">Mourinho once said ‘A team with 11 Cesar Azpilicuetas could win the Champions League’ because football is not just about the pure talent. Football is also about character and personality and Azpilicueta has all those traces of a winning personality.</p>

*Ok, maybe 10 Azpi and 1 Hazard!*

<p class="graf--p">Football is a team sports, no questions asked. Not only Azpi is a big game specialist (refer 1.), Azpilicueta is second to none for consistency and reliability. A team player like him, Phillip Lahm or Zabaleta is the greatest asset for any manager. Mourinho's melodramatic statement was not meant to be taken seriously, but it goes to show how much a consistent performer is valued in modern football.</p>

<h4 class="graf--h4">3. To be the best of yourself</h4>
<blockquote class="graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">“No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” — Socrates (Greek philosopher)</blockquote>
<p class="graf--p">I don't have to say much here. There's simply no virtue in mediocrity. Zilch. Nada. Nobody respects the guy who give a half-ass attempt on his work. Yes, it’s indeed not rocket science, stop playing FIFA and get your ass off the ground.</p>
<p class="graf--p">Don’t wait until you're accepted into the school team, or that trial, or that contract. From today on, you are a professional. It is your job to train. It is your job to be the best of yourself. Live and die by the sword, they say.</p>

<blockquote class="graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">“For me, what makes Frank Lampard special is how professional he is in training,” “You see him at training: He is the first to arrive on the training ground and the last to go home. “He won everything with Chelsea, he’s a legend in football and he’s still playing <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">like he’s 18 years old</strong>.” — Zabaleta on Lampard</blockquote>
<p class="graf--p">Train hard, no matter what phase of the career you in. But wait, how intensive is ‘like a 18 years old’?</p>
<p class="graf--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">What else do you train for? There's a handful of other reasons to share, but first let us know your calling. Comment below.</em></p>
