<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As someone who’s been through the motions of this exact question and has had to make some really tough life-changing decisions between going to university and focusing on a football career, it’s my duty to lend and share my advice with you. Like I said </span><span class="s3"><b>it’s tough</b></span><span class="s1">, but there is a way to combine your playing ambitions and study.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You need to have the mindset that anything is possible, and in this day and age, that is truly possible. With the developments of online scouting and trials, the ways you can promote yourself range in many different new ways.</span></p>
<p class="p3">In this post I'll also share with you which Manchester United player studied for not one, but <strong>two</strong> university degrees.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>First things first with university: </b></span></p>

<ul>
 	<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Uni is flexible</span></li>
 	<li class="p3"><span class="s1">You have long holidays or periods of free time.</span></li>
 	<li class="p3">You have chances to skip a week or two if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Uni is not time consuming(unless you are studying over 30 hours per week), but going out and socialising are.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Most clubs in lower leagues have players that study/work simultaneously.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Quite a few players have completed university before moving onto a pro club. Anton Peterlin (former Everton), Yuto Nagamoto (Inter Milan) and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32230300">Yoshinori Muto completing his economics degree, a fortnight before receiving interest from Chelsea</a> are examples of that.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Manchester United's Juan Mata is the player that studied for <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2098984/Chelseas-Juan-Mata-exclusive-Two-degrees-backpacking.html">two university degrees</a>.</p>

</ol>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If there does come a moment where you have to choose between a contract or opportunity and your studies, you decide.</span></p>
