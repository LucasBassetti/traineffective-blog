<h2 class="p2" style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>" I want to play professionally, but how do I get a soccer trial or tryout? "</strong></em></h2>
</blockquote>
<p class="p2">I receive this question from readers almost on a daily basis, but I have yet to see a good guide about getting a football trial on the internet. This is pretty shocking, because at some point in time, millions of players must ask themselves this very question if they want to make something of themselves. I asked myself this when I was struggling to get somewhere because in order to build your career, you must have chances to <strong>prove yourself</strong>.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Many reading this may have the skill required to succeed, but lack the connections. But let me tell you something... over the past six years I haven't had <strong>one single opportunity</strong> handed to me... I created <strong>all 20+ of them</strong> myself from thin air.  I too had no connections, but I still managed to get trials with professional teams around the world.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In this post, I’ll show you the exact messages and techniques I used to get trials with:</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Australian U/20 National Team</span></li>
 	<li class="p3"><span class="s1">AFC Wimbledon (England)</span></li>
 	<li class="p3"><span class="s1">FC Volendam (Netherlands)</span></li>
 	<li class="p3"><span class="s1">FC Montrose (Scotland)</span></li>
 	<li class="p3"><span class="s1">Kazincbarcika (Hungary)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’ll also tell you about my experiences in Europe with trial camps and dodgy agents. If you want to know more about getting a soccer tryout, this information is going to be gold for you. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Getting a trial takes a combination of skill and marketing 101. In this first part we’ll focus on the ways you can get a trial in football.</span></p>

<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>7 Ways to Get a Soccer Trial</b></span></h2>
<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>#1) Football Sc</b></span><span class="s1"><b>outs</b></span></h2>

![Soccer Scout](/img/blog/soccer-scout.jpg)
*Soccer Scout*

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is the most common way players get trials. If you play for one of the best teams in your area, your team gets to the finals of a major youth competition or plays in a famous tournament, chances are that scouts will be in attendance watching you. Most top players of current and previous generations got their first chance this way. However there are many factors which determine if a scout ever sees you or not. That depends on where you play, the level of your team and your age which is why the 7 other ways listed here are very important. It’s very easy to get overlooked. </span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A piece of advice which my coach always said to me: <strong><i>“You never know who’s watching you, so always give your best"</i></strong></span></p>
<p class="p3">That piece of advice worked for him. In a war-torn country, <a href="https://youtu.be/DPtt6F3agtI?t=1m14s">a soldier happened to watch him play</a>, and sneaked him onto a ship to flee the country and start his pro career.</p>

<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b># 2) Football Agents</b></span></h2>

![Agents what they really look like](/img/blog/agents-what-they-really-look-like.jpg)
*What you think a football agent looks like vs [Right] Mino Raiola who manages stars like Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Mario Balotelli to name a few.*

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An agents main function is to advertise you to his ‘network’ of scouts and coaches. They also be someone you can get career advice from. In return they receive 10% of your salary and/or an upfront fee.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An old coach of mine once told me to “not ever trust an agent”. I didn’t (want) to listen to him and I ended up wasting valuable time, money and effort. The first (and last) trial organised by my agent, I spent in Montrose, Scotland - a small fishing village on the Eastern coast of Scotland. I remember walking into the club for the first training and the coach actually asked what me and a fellow trialist of the same agent were there for. Somehow, me and the other trialist spent 7 weeks there in a bed and breakfast, living off Tesco meal deals and fish and chip take-aways all whilst training just once or twice a week. The worst part was waking up everyday not knowing what was happening due to a serious lack of communication by the agent, coaches and the club. While this is my own personal experience, I’ve heard on many occasions of the same sort of thing happening to other players.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now you can understand why I dislike and distrust agents, and naturally I feel it's my duty (for not listening to my coach) to tell you once again ‘<strong>don’t trust agents!</strong>’ <em>UNLESS</em> that person is a close personal or family friend, or he’s been recommended to you by someone who's had that agent before and has achieved success thanks to him.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And If you ever do sign an agreement with an agent, please make sure that it’s non-exclusive (meaning you can have multiple agents instead of just one) and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don’t ever</span> pay an upfront fee!</span></p>

<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>#3) Football </b></span><span class="s1"><b>Trial Days &amp; Football Camps</b></span></h2>

![Football Trial](/img/blog/football-trial.jpg)
*Football Trial*

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Over the past decade or so, trial days and camps have become a very popular way of getting noticed. Companies such as <a href="http://www.footballcv.com">FootballCV</a> will charge you between 15 and 90 pounds to have you play at a venue where supposedly they have scouts watching. I actually used FootballCV a couple of times and got to play (even use the same dressing rooms) at West Ham’s Upton Park and Stadium MK near London. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Although there are many success stories posted on these websites, I don’t know anyone personally who achieved great success using this medium.</span></p>

<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>#4) Email</b></span></h2>

![Marks Email](/img/blog/marks-email.png)
*After sending a ton of emails, I finally managed to get my first trial with AFCW when I was 16.*

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Clubs get dozens of emails every day with players asking if they can get a trial. The far majority of requests are ignored and many clubs have a policy of “If the kid is good enough, we’ll know about it”. However, if you make your email stand out and try to grab attention, you might just have a chance. That’s something we’ll focus on in part 2. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I got my first trial at AFC Wimbledon by sending an email. Though might I add, 1 positive response might take <strong>50-100 emails</strong> to receive. The lower the league the club plays in, the easier it is to get a response, so don’t expect to get a response from the big guns.</span></p>

<h2 class="p3"><b>#5) Private Full-Time Football Academies</b></h2>

![The FootballCV Academy](/img/blog/footballcv.jpg)
*The FootballCV Academy*

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nowadays you have full-time private football academies that put players under a full-time training schedule. In that time, the player can supposedly develop and perform in matches in front of scouts or professional teams. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You might have seen the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NikeAcademy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nike Football Academy </a>where thousands of players from all over the world apply to get ‘the chance’ to join the academy in England where they play against Premier League and European opposition. <a href="http://www.footballcvacademy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FootballCV Soccer Academy</a> and the <a href="http://www.prodirectsocceracademy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pro-Direct Soccer Academy</a> are organisations that also come to mind.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The only downside is that these academies can get pretty expensive and will cost you upwards of <strong>10,000-20,000 pounds</strong> per year.</span></p>

<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>#6) Football Coaches/Personal Connections/Mentors</b></span></h2>

![Terry and Mourinho](/img/blog/terry-and-mourinho.jpg)
*John Terry and Jose Mourinho are said to have had a very close relationship on and off the field since he took over in 2004.*

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This method is by far the most <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effective</span> way to get a soccer trial - having a strong relationship with a coach, connection or mentor. This is because they personally know you and how you play. If your coach really believes in you and thinks you can succeed at a higher level, that means they trust you to do well and are already willing to promote you to their network. Trust is by far the hardest thing to build, so use it wisely.</span></p>

<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>#7) LinkedIn</b></span></h2>

![LinkedIn for Football](/img/blog/linkedin-for-soccer.png)
*LinkedIn for Football*

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">LinkedIn is a place where a lot of coaches and players have created profiles however, many of them just create an account and forget about it, or they don’t know how to use it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">LinkedIn can be very effective because it can get you in direct contact with people who can pull strings for you (scouts and directors), or even the decision maker (the person who will decide whether you can get a soccer trial or not).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s pretty easy to connect with people on the platform and chances are your message will get read (though don’t count on a response).</span></p>

<h2 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Special Mention: Fieldoo</b></span></h2>

![Fieldoo screenshot](/img/blog/fieldoo-screenshot.jpg)
*Fieldoo screenshot*

<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.fieldoo.com">Fieldoo</a> is slowly revolutionising the way players get opportunities in the football world, so I wanted to shout this out as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>special mention</strong></span>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The whole purpose of Fieldoo is for players to connect with agents, get seen and <strong>apply for soccer trials</strong>. They’ve done well so far, and in the past 2-3 years they’ve amassed over 150,000 players/agents on the platform.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now I know that I blasted agents earlier in the post, but Fieldoo may be an exception provided you connect with agents that have a <strong>reputation</strong>, are proven to be <strong>trusted</strong> by players and can work out <strong>non-exclusive</strong> contracts. </span></p>

<h1 class="p3" style="text-align: center;">But Really Guys...ABOVE ALL these tips, This here is TRULY the Bottom Line!</h1>
<p class="p3"><span class="_2uma">I can tell ALL of you right now that <em>NOTHING</em> that will happen unless you actually have the ABILITY.
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="_2uma">Sure I earned lots of chances, but only because people noticed that I had something which I worked for.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="_2uma">I worked <strong>20 hours a week</strong> for years on my game, because to become a top player it takes <strong><a href="http://blog.fieldoo.com/2014/02/want-to-be-the-next-ronaldo-practice-10000-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10,000 hours of practice</a>.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3">At age 16, my ability was just ok, I never played for any academy and I played in the second lowest division for my age group in Australia of all places!!</p>
<p class="p3">But I made the commitment to dedicate myself and to work HOURS on my game. Everyday I did a ton of different exercises to work on my technique, improve dribbling, shooting, fitness, speed, passing and also analysed some of the top players to become smarter.</p>
<p class="p3">By age 18, I was offered a contract to play professionally and the players on <a href="http://traineffective.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TrainEffective.com</a> have been getting similar results.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="_2uma">
YOU need to put in the WORK to get noticed. YOU need to go out there and TRAIN.</span></p>
The TRUTH is many of you will read of this advice and start doing these things without actually having the mentality, focus and skill required.
<p class="p3"><span class="_2uma"> Only the real, truly motivated players will DO SOMETHING about it.</span></p>
To the REAL PLAYERS, I applaud you. Keep hustling.

To the others, take a good look about how much work your willing to put in on-the-field to even give yourself a chance in the first place.

Because in the end, becoming successful is all down to how much you want it.
